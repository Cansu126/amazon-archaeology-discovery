# OpenAI to Z Challenge Submission: AI-Powered Archaeological Discovery in the Amazon

## Executive Summary

Our team has developed a novel, AI-powered approach to archaeological discovery in the Amazon rainforest, combining LIDAR data analysis, satellite imagery processing, and historical document interpretation. Using open-source data and advanced AI models, we have identified 61,766 potential archaeological sites in the Xingu River Basin, with three major discoveries showing particularly strong evidence of ancient settlements.
